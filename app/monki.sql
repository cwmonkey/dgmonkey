You are the Ultimate Monkey bro! I would also like to say thanks for all my supporters through the years. Thanks for continuing to "Monkey Around".\n\nAs many of you know, I am now doing the Disc Golf thing full-time. This has allowed me more time to focus my efforts on tournaments, inventory, and many other things I have wanted to do for a long time. We will have our discs and gear for sale on the website soon. As for the tournaments, the 2009 Monkey Tour is on it''s way.\n\nThe Lucky 13 Open was the official kick off event of the year. The opener was held in Republic, MO on a course I designed and installed back in December. This event was nothing short of awesome thanks to the Republic Parks & Recreation Department (director Jared Keiling), local sponsors, sponsors from outside the area, the Monkey Team, and all the players who came out to play. Sixty nine players from four different states took part in the event.\n\nOn May 23rd, the Monkey Tour will take us to Miami, OK for it''s first PDGA event. The 1st Riverview Open will be held at Riverview park. The Ottawa County Disc Golf Club (OCDGC) has been diligently raising money for the event. The following weekend on May 30th, we will be headed south to Bentonville, AR for the 2nd Annual Lake Bella VistOpen. Randal Reisner (part of Team Monkey) has started the ball rolling and has come up with quite a few sponsors. We will be adding $500 cash to the Pro payout and the same amount will be divided in the Amateur fields! Both events will be well worth the trip.

Eighteen portable Pole Holes were put out for the tournament on a course designed by Russ Burns owner of Disc Golf Monkey.

Rick Nichols from Nixa took home top honors with an eleven under par 96 to hold off Russ Burns by one stroke in his first professional division victory. Chad Fisk demolished the Intermediate field by more than 10 strokes (move up in divisions Chad). Chris Dangler, who canned a 75'' putt in a three way playoff won the Recreational division over local Bryce Fisk, and Brad Hilton (from Lebanon). Bruce Heidebrecht of Willard, took home top honors in the Masters division by six over Tim Arndt from Springfield. In his debut tournament, Luke Carter took 1st in the Junior division.\n\nBoth rounds were played in a mild wind that was almost rain free.

Along with great weather, there was an eager and excited buzz about the land, layout , and potential for a permanent course at Baldwin.

The reports from those who played the course were definitely positive. Thank you Russ for all your hard work and dedication. If your drive didnâ€™t stay on the fairway there were probably thorns in your future. There was considerable blood shed on this course as well as many lost discs. \n	In Saturdays tournament Russ Burns won the open division.  Mark Anderson and Aaron Ulrich had a playoff for first in the advanced division were Mark brought home the victory. Jaysin Smith took top honors among the intermediate players and Kyle Sunde blew away the competition in beginners. \n	On Sunday 2 rounds of double were played. The first round was random draw doubles, Russ Burns and Rick Nichols won that round shooting a -17 with an ace. The Second round was pick your partner and Aaron Ulrich and Rick Nichols shot -16 that round. During the second round of doubles 2 set of chains (The Missing Links) were hidden on the course.

The course also has two pin position options and two tee pads per hole.  The course was designed by Jerry Steele, Bill Paulson and finalized by Pep Grant Manager Randy Vogel.  The remaining four baskets were placed into a "Skill Shot" teaching area that will allow teachers and students to take part in an outdoor "hands on" disc golf classroom.  Teachers will teach students the skills they need on a disc golf course in a condenced area.  This brilliant and well thought out area was developed by Bill Paulson (Great Job Bill).

Thanks to State Farm and Kevin Elrod!\r\n\r\nThe event ended with an After Party at Fat Daddy''s.

If you had the pleasure of knowing Dale, you would know that he worked hard at everything he did, and this course was no exception.  Dale was a major part in getting Disc Golf into McCulley Park.  After putting in the initial 9 holes, he was determined to complete the 18 hole course, as he added 3 holes at a time.  After 15 were in the ground, he designed the final 3 holes that included his favorite hole number 6 (which is the favorite of many who play).  His plan was to install the final 3 holes on a Monday, just before he was to be the Tournament Director of Nixa''s first PDGA event.  Sadly and very unfortunately, Dale was unable to to see the course complete or TD that event, as he passed away the Sunday before.  The Nixa Center was quick to complete the course and name the McCulley disc golf course after him in his honor and memory.  Each year we all have an opportunity to remember or pay our respects to the man and family who was instrumental in establishing this challenging and fun course.

From the players pack, to the course, to the incredible pay out, the Finale will be a tough act to follow.  Each year this event has been in a different location.  The third time was definitely a charm!  In the DGM''s first Finale we had pretty good financial support from sponsors, but not the best course/venue.  The second Finale we had a  piece of land that was second to none on beauty, but little financial backing.  This year both aspects were present, and it was made relatively easy to make a successful tournament. \r\n\r\nDespite only being a PDGA sanctioned C Tier event, players were treated to an incredible players pack that included custom long sleeve t shirt (designed by Keith Douglas and printed by Creator Designs), an upper end Innova disc, a tripod stool sticker, a free sandwich card from McDonald''s, and a free lunch provided by John Paul''s Gathering Place...wait this is a C Tier?!  The major reason for the over the top players pack was because the Harrison Convention and Visitors Bureau or the CVB supported in a huge way!  Matt Bell the Director of Sports made funding this possible opening the door for a great course venue.  Local restaurant owner Jamie Akers eagerly offered to supply lunch from John Pauls Gathering Place, and host a sight of the after party (this contact was also provided by Matt).  \r\n\r\nOn top of the players pack, the course was a super challenging par 58 with many different types of holes: wooded, open, flat, elevated, flat, but must of all beautiful!  This was the Finale and the land lent itself to a challenging and difficult course, so that is what I chose to design.  Rarely does an opportunity arise like this, and I wanted to showcase the North Ark College land.  I think the mission was accomplished!  Although not an easy course, all who played finished and enjoyed the day of golf.  \r\n\r\nAs always, the pay out was much higher than the average C tier events.  With the Monkey''s mobile store present, it allowed players to pick their prizes.  This continued  trend has been very popular by the players over the years.  With the help from Dynamic Discs, Discs Unlimited, and Innova, there were a lot of several â€œhard to get plasticâ€ available along with a wide variety of normal stock discs by many different manufacturers!  DD and DU also sponsored CTP holes on the course for added prizes.  Adding an exciting part to the pay out was a custom Monkey Trap that was raffled to one of the Amateur winners.  The winner was local Female Recreational Champion Christine West!  Open champion Doug Wiegand pocketed near $200.  Pretty nice pay out for only 7 pros in attendance. Although it was posted $500 added, there was more than that added!  \r\n\r\nThe always fun â€œMust Be Present to Winâ€ EDGE raffle was held at John Paul''s Gathering Place.  Doug and Teresa Duff were the winners of the big ticket item, the Innova Discatcher Sport.  Also raffled was the year long raffle for a Monkey Trap.  This raffle was done all year offering tickets for sale and for the purchase of Tour T Shirts/Polos. This year''s winner was Joplin''s own Zack Jones.  He has chosen to  get a custom color basket, and when it is finished I will post a picture of the basket and him.

With the DGM Finale last month as the conclusion of the 2011 Evolution Tour, we are excited to offer one last tournament.  Before, during, and after the Finale I was asked if it would be my last event of the year, and with some gentle persuasion I decided to make one last go in 2011.  It was easy  deciding where to hold this event especially with the â€œnewnessâ€ at the beautiful and redesigned Grubaugh Park in Ozark, MO.  With Jeff Beth at the helm, the Grubaugh course has under gone a very successful face lift, making it arguably the best course in the Springfield area.  \r\n\r\nJeff Beth and I discussed a tournament and agreed the Winter Blast Tournament would be a fun idea and would allow the new design to be showcased.  Along with the opportunity to play the new lay out, we also agreed it would make a perfect opportunity to help a local charity (much like the Ice Bowl''s).  In only a short one day notice, Jeff found a much deserving charity to play for.  The Christian County Family Crisis Center is local to Ozark and provides many services to the area.  Lynn Buehler, one of the directors, spoke with us and thought it sounded like a great idea.  Having never heard of the sport, she mentioned possibly playing in the future (when it warms up of coarse).  Jeff and I are excited about this event and hope you can make it!   \r\n\r\nI hope that this will be a last â€œFixâ€ that will get people through to the Ice Bowl season.  This event is designed to be fun filled, charity driven, and showcase a more challenging 18 at Grubaugh.  This event will have a very fun an unique twist called the Mulligan Turkey Trott (MTT).  As the flier mentions there will be 6 mulligans sold for $5.  With this $5 donation (that will be given to the CCFCC) you will be entered into the MTT.  For every turkey you get (Turkey = 3 consecutive birdies), you will earn a shot at a short CTP hole at the end of play.  For those who wish to save their Mulligans, the Mulligans may be traded for shots at the CTP.  So far we have been given 2 Turkeys to give out by Price Cutter (thanks for the leg work Jeff)!  The MTT should be a great time and will allow more money to be raised for the CCFCC.  As always, expect the same â€œMonkey Style Pay Outâ€ which is picking your own winnings from the Monkey Mobile Store.\r\n\r\nHow can you help?  First, we need to spread the word about this event and get as many players to play as possible.  The more players we have, the more we raise for the CCFCC.  Second, We are needing donations in one of two ways.  Along with the 5 cans of food or $5 as part of the entry, Lynn has provided a top needs list for the CCFCC that include:  Non perishable food (cereals especially), cleaning supplies, laundry and other soap items, and women/children''s clothing (please bring gently used or new clothing items).  If you have any way of getting these types of items, please bring them to the event and they will be donated.  Also, we are wanting to have more than just Turkeys to give out at the Turkey Trott.  Any prize type items would be greatly appreciated (these do not have to be disc golf related).  The last way you can help is by letting us know if you know a business/individual that would like to be a part through a sponsorship.  If you do please let Jeff or I know know as soon as possible!  â€œTis the seasonâ€, and our season to help others continues!\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, about this event, or the upcoming 2012 Tour (including your city being a part) please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thirty-Eight players came and helped raise $250 in cash and countless nonperishable food items, cleaning supplies, and other much needed items!  The weather was near perfect, when considering we are only a week from Christmas.  The day was sunny, with almost no wind, and it was close to 50 degrees, making it much easier to launch discs through the air.  Jeff Beth''s back 18 design complimented the new 18 design and made for a fun and challenging event.\r\n\r\nThere were 5 divisions with players coming from as far as Marshall and St. Louis to play.  In the Recreational Division, Stephan Schelp shot a 12 down 96 to win.  The Intermediate Division was taken by Chad Fisk, shooting one stroke better with a 13 down 95.  In the Advanced Division it was TJ Hahn who blistered a 93, 15 down to walk away victoriously.  In the Grand Master division it was Marshall''s own Jon Parsons shooting a 4 down 104 to take home the title.  In a remarkable display of driving and putting, it was Joplin''s Zack Jones, who took over all honors in the Open Pro division.  Zack held off local Aaron Ulrich by 2, shooting an 18 under 90 for the tournament.  Congratulations to all the winners! \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, there was $250 raised for the CCFCC.  This was done in two ways. First we charged an entry plus 5 cans of food (or other needed items) or $5 extra.  Eighteen players paid the $5 making the total $90.  The second way was done in a fun Mulligan Turkey Trott Closest to the Pin game.  Six mulligans were offered for $5 and allowed the player to be a part of the Turkey Trott that was sponsored by Price Cutter, who donated two turkeys for the game.  How the game worked was players were given the option to use or save their mulligans.  If the mulligans were saved they were able to be turned in to free throws in the Turkey Trott Closest to the Pin.  Also, during the round if you had three birdies in a row (known as a Turkey), you also were given a free throw.  At the end of the tournament 32 players turned in their throws during the Turkey Trott CTP which raised $160 more, putting the total at $250.  The big winners of the highly coveted gobblers were Team Monkey''s Jake Whitehead, and the other gobbler was one by the new and 1st time tournament player, the one and only, man simply known as... Stoney.  The Winter Blast was truly a great time and an awesome way to end a fun packed year of disc golf! \r\n\r\nAs if the above were not enough, Jeff and I had the opportunity to deliver the food, cleaning supplies, and the money to the CCFCC.  We met most of the Team that worked there and could see how devoted they were to their cause.  All were overly thankful and were eager to show us the facility and share their vision.  It was awesome to know that what was donated had the potential to change lives as it was explained to us by director Lynn Buehler Executive Director and Dawn Decker Resident Manager.   Both sent their support and thanks to the Disc Golf Community.  They even showed interest in the game.  A big â€œthank youâ€ to all who helped.\r\n\r\nIt was truly a special time of giving back and realizing that no matter what happened on the course, at the end of the day it should truly be about serving others.

The feedback about the tournaments from players has been very supportive, and with your help I plan on making things even better in 2012.

Close to $8,000 was raised and given back to the above charities.  It was very tough seeing the devastation that Joplin and the surrounding areas went through and are still recovering from, but it was very moving and humbling to see how the family of disc golfers came together to show support.  If  for no other reason the act of giving back made the Evolution Tour successful!  Your efforts have made a difference.

As you noticed the Lebanon Ice Bowl will be the Lucky Monkey Tour opener.  I am thankful the Lebanon parks department was eager to support both these events this year.  Lebanon parks have purchased a Monkey Trap that will be raffled to raise money for the LAF at this year''s Ice Bowl.  This was done last year and Gary Bramen of Camdenton turned it in to a new 10 hole course (great job Gary you are a champ!).  We are hoping to get more players this year than last, and we are confident we will help the Lebanon Area Foundation out even more this year!  There will be a chile dinner provided like every year.  If you make a mean pot of chile, bring it...Chile contest perhaps?!  I''m sure we can come up with some cool prizes for that!  The Parks department has done a great job adding all concrete pads, making a huge 10 foot hill that will provide for an elevated pin placement on hole 16, and they made some beautiful additions around some tee pads that will allow for some beautiful landscaping this Spring.  Stay tuned for more details on the Jared Hilton Memorial.  For those of you who didn''t make the Hillbilly Open last year, this event is taking it''s place.  It should be one of the bigger and more well funded events on the tour.  I hope to see you at both!', '2012-01-23 10:25:46', 1, 1, 1);

The sixty-six players this year nearly doubled the amount from last year''s 36.  The 30 extra players helped raise $1,060, topping last year''s total of $576.  The Lebanon Area Foundation will be presented with the check very soon along with the food that was donated.  I am so excited by the over whelming support that was given to both the LAF and to DGM.  I am very thankful that you chose Lebanon to finish out the Ice Bowl season. You guys are incredible.  Great work and Thank You to all of you.\r\n\r\nIf the attendance and money raised for the LAF was not enough, the weather, play, and the pay out may  have rounded off a near perfect day of disc golf.  Rarely can this Arizona native wear a long sleeve shirt and survive in February, but the crazy warmth of this winter continued.  Sunshine with a moderate wind, was a prime recipe for a beautiful day of disc golf. There were 5 divisions that included: Open, Advanced, Intermediate, Recreational, and Women.  All divisions were very competitive with the biggest margin of victory being only 3 strokes in the Women''s division.  Melissa White from Jeff City bested Brandy Monnahan with a 137. The Rec division won by Mark Komoroski shooting a 112, was the tightest field in the tournament.  Second place was a 3 way tie for second only a stroke off the pace by Tuner, Jonathan Cook, and Mike Sisco.  Winning the Intermediate field was Springfield''s own Nathan Clark turning in a 105 that held off Nate Love by a stick.  Kyle Webster''s 101 was enough for a two stroke finish over fellow Joplin golfer Frank â€œthe Tankâ€.  The Open division was full of excitement from start to finish.  Corey''s ace helped give him a considerable 3 stroke lead over Zack Jones, Shayn Woltz and myself.  With a 43 matched by Mark Anderson, I was able to win by a single stroke making my 49 first round score, only one better than Mark''s in the first round making the difference.  For full results, click on the Tournament Tab, scroll down to Past Tournaments,  and click on results.\r\n\r\nThe pay out was nothing short of amazing for the Ice Bowl.  The ultimate winner was Nathan Clark winning both his division, and the custom $375 Monkey Trap that was raffled off to helped raise money for the LAF.  I often tell players if they are looking for an over the top Pay Out the Ice Bowl is not one to play.  This was far from the truth for this payout because of money added to the pay out by individuals in attendance.  Like all DGM events, vouchers used like cash on merchandise were given out, along with a Pro cash pay out.  Many players commented on how mind boggling the pay out was.  On behalf of all the players, I say thank you to all the sponsors and the City of Lebanon for their support of this year''s Lebanon Ice Bowl.

Both the city and the club were gracious in there help and sponsorship for the event.  The shirt and disc in the player''s pack were well received, and so were the great hamburgers that were prepared by Chris Johnson (who didn''t play so he could cook)!  From all the players, Thank You!  I am looking forward to a return trip (and hope to redeem my poor shooting).   \r\n\r\nFriday''s weather was a bit on the scary side with rain and very strong winds.  Several people braved the elements and played a doubles round despite the conditions.  Congratulations to Cory Anderson and Shayn Woltz who took first with an incredible 51 score!  Also cashing, was TJ Hahn and Chad Fisk who finished second with a very respectable 55.  These were incredible scores for a calm day, but for the winds that day provided the scores were obscene.  Great job fellas!  \r\n\r\nSaturday''s forecast was beautiful and made for a very enjoyable event.  There were 57 players with 7 divisions.  The course played tough as expected, with only two players finishing under par.  Both Frank the Tank, and Zack Jones were rewarded for their stellar performances winning their divisions.  Open champion â€œTankâ€, put together a brilliant second round 6 under that distanced himself above second place finisher George Smith.  Zack, who has been playing Open, elected to play Advanced and smashed the field...Is sand bagger to harsh I ask?  Great shooting bud!  Other winners included: C D Steiner a true legend of the game out of Kansas City took the Pro Masters division over local Jon Parsons (who moved up for this event), Stan Balke took 1st in the Advanced Grand Masters division, Brenda Lowe in the Women''s division, Kenneth Squires who played a long play off with Brad Hilton before taking the crown in Intermediate, and Tyler Foreman who has had back to back wins on the tour earning him the SAND BAGGER award (No more Recreation for you Tyler)!

Ray, who owns Noel Pharmacy in Noel, MO, has worked hard to round up support for this event.  He has rallied sponsors from around Noel and along the Elk River that we will be floating down for the tourney.  The list is impressive being that there is no course in the local area.  Sponsors include: Noel Pharmacy, PBA Health, Landon Feed & Seed, Kathy''s Kountry Kitchen, The Hog Shop, Arvest Bank, McDonald County, Main Sweets, Annie''s Pizza, and Bluff Dwellers Cavern.

Once registered, players will be shuttled to the canoe launch site in groups of 4-8.  If you show up after 11:00 AM I doubt there will be anyone there...so please don''t miss the boat/canoe!  The reason for the dead line is because the float is several hours long and when combining the 18 holes, well, it will take a while.\r\n\r\nFor those who are going to camp, there are several sites that are supporting this event.  Shady Beach at http://www.shadybeach.com , River Ranch http://www.riverranchresort.com , and Two Sons http://www.twosonsfloats.com .  Please check rates and support these facilities as they are eagerly anticipating the presence of Disc Golf!  I know there are both primitive camping and cabins available.   I''m sure cabins are limited so reserve early.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Floatin'' Fling has caught the attention of many around the area.  I am very excited that one of my best and longest supporting sponsors will be at this one.  My great friends and owners of Discs Unlimited, Dennis & Annetta Volshultz, have said they will be there.  Dennis mentioned today (as several of you have) he was happy that disc golf and floating were combined because they were two of his favorite things to do.

There are several pre registrations and it looks like it is going to be a great turn out for this One-of-a-Kind tournament.  There have been many calls with questions concerning Pre Registration, Non Players floating but not playing, Divisions, and Groupings.  I hope to answer these in detail.  If you still have questions don''t hesitate to call, text or e mail additional questions.\r\n\r\nAs for Pre Registration: The benefit of registering early is getting the â€œbetter plastic discâ€ and getting the right shirt size (shirt sizing is done on a first come first serve basis).  For this event the first 40 players have there choice of the Blizzard Boss or Destroyer (also available are DX Aviars and Rocs).  (All players will receive a custom stamped disc and shirt.)  \r\nYou may pre register in two ways:\r\n1) Contact me via e mail, text, or by phone and pay at the shop. \r\n2) Go to http://www.paypal.com Send your entry fee plus $2/ Player (a Pay Pal Fee) to discgolfer8@yahoo.com . Please include you name, the tournament name, your Division, address, Phone number, disc selection, and shirt size.\r\n\r\nMany of you have asked if a spouse or significant other may float with you.  The answer is a definite Yes!  All players entries pay for one half of the $35 canoe rental fee.  So if you choose to bring someone along that doesn''t play you will pay $17.50 to cover the other half of the canoe rental.  Also, Tyson has provided us with enough food to accommodate as many people as we can get to attend.  The $5 dinner fee (which is also covered by the registration fee) can also be paid by the non player and participate in the dinner.  All the proceeds for the dinner will go to the Noel Betterment Association.\r\n\r\nDivisions are going to be the same as normal tournaments, requiring 3 to make a division.  There is one exception however regarding divisions.  For this event, I am adding a Novice Division.  The Novice Division (for this tournament), is for players who have not played before.  This is designed for two main types of people: locals who have not heard of Disc Golf and would like to give it a try, and the ride-along-significant-others who would not normally play.  I am hoping that as many people who come will take part in the â€œFlingâ€ as well as the â€œFloatin''â€!  Getting a large number of players will definitely help next year as we try to get more sponsors and attempt to grow this event.\r\n\r\nThe groupings will be done based on when you show up.  The Canoe Rentals have asked that we have groups of 4-8 to shuttle from the registration area to the launch site.  You will need at least 3 players per group to set out to play.  Try to keep your groups to 3 to 5 players to keep a steady flow.  Although you will only be competing against players in your division, you may get placed in a group with players competing in different divisions. Playing with friends is encouraged so schedule times to meet so you can get paired together!  \r\n\r\nDON''T FORGET REGISTRATION IS BETWEEN 7:00AM AND 11:00AM\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a blast!

There were two ladie , Mary Whitehead and Christine West, in the women''s intermediate division.  Mary, in her first tourney back in about two years, took home first place.  The Recreational division (the largest field of 32), was won by Springfield native Derick Norris followed by Derred Scheperle of Los Angeles, California.  The Intermediate Division was dominated by Trevor Erickson who shot an amazing 55 that was only topped by a 54 from the Open field.  Trevor''s tournament total 116 was the 3rd best score in the tournament and would have landed him in 3rd in the Open division.  There is some motivation to step up Eric (Great first round and tournament!).  The Advanced division was a tight battle that ended in a 119 tie between Rolla''s Ish Keener and Joplin''s Andrew Jinks.  In the first hole of the sudden death Andrew prevailed.  The rather large eleven player Open field was won by Russ Burns who shot only one better on the first round and two on the second  than Kyle McClure of Springdale, AR.\r\n\r\nThe next two events are back to back at the end of July.  The Monkey Trap Open, brought to you by title sponsor NNWA, will be on the 21st of July in Springdale, AR.  The following weekend will be the Pitt Open held in Pitts burg, KS that may be premiering a brand new Monkey Trap course at Schlanger Park (the site of this event for the last few years)!  Both of the even fliers are posted.  Keep coming back for updates on these events!\r\n\r\nUntil next time keep them flying straight when you need them to!', '2012-06-27 09:39:23', 1, 1, 1);

INSERT INTO `ladedgm_news` VALUES(225, 1, 'The Lucky Monkey Tour and Finale Recap', 'The Finale''s 100 Player field was another maxed out event for the Lucky Monkey Tour 2012.  Of the Eleven PDGA events held this year, over half (six) were full or over flowing.  The Lucky 13, Jared Hilton Memorial, Monkey Trap Open, Pitt Open, 4 States Open, and the Finale were the other events that had 90 plus in attendance!  To say the sport is growing in the area is an under statement.  What is even more incredible is that the attendance to these events is starting to be filled with both old and new players.  It is no longer the same crowd/competition.  Events in Marshall, Springdale, Jeff City and Rolla were packed with first time Monkey tournament players.  This year the Lucky Monkey Tour averaged 88 players per PDGA event.  That is a huge leap from the previous years.  What will 2013 bring?  What ever it may be you can be a part.  Check back to see the 2013 Tour schedule... coming soon!\n\nThe Finale in Rolla was a true showcase event.  What made the Finale special was a combination of things; the obvious season ending tournament, playing on a difficult course, hosting a huge maxed out field, dealing with relentless winds, and watching the day light disappear ever so so quickly. All  of these made for a tournament to remember.  Rolla''s Club, area sponsors, tour sponsors, and one hundred of the coolest players on the planet teamed with DGM to put on a top notch event that all can be proud of.  There were 9 Divisions that included the following; Junior, Wn Rec, Wn Int, Wn Adv, ADV Grand Master, Rec, Int, Adv, and Open.  Seeing 100 players was incredible, and having eleven women and a junior was icing on the cake.  \n\nUnfortunately the 2 holes added were not enough to accommodate the few who did not Pre Register.    With day light being a huge issue,  the discussion with local Andy Roden to only add two holes was a good decision.  Several groups (mine included) did run out of light before their round was finished.  â€œI guess next year you could call it the Flash Light Openâ€, was said by one comedian...that does have a good ring to it.  The darkness definitely made it tough toward the end, but the wind was the main factor that kept many scores much higher than expected.  Thankfully for November, the temperatures were in the 70''s which was a true blessing.\n\nThis year''s Finale: Scott Moore-JR, Kara Stauffer-Rec Wn, Kevin Robison-Rec Men, Alana Fawcett Int-Wn, Tyler Foreman-Int Men, Jon Parsons-Adv Gr Mast, Rebekah Kersey-Adv Wn, Dereck Green-Adv Men, George Smith- Open Men.  All of these players deserve a big Congratulations as they were able to hang tough through the conditions.  Great Job!\n\nThere were three Monkey Traps given away that night.  Many of you who were unable to attend were probably hoping I would call that night to congratulate you on winning a Monkey Trap, but all the winners were in attendance.  The three contests were; The Vibram CTP/Ace contest, the Tour T- Shirt Raffle Basket, and the Finale Raffle all offered a Monkey Trap.  Jake Stehr, from Bolivar, MO took home the Black and YellowVibram Monkey Trap (several Mizzou fans were jealous), Brian Lansford, of Jeff City, took home the loud orange Monkey Trap, and local boy Noah Rienks took home the Black and Blue Monkey Trap.  Congratulations to all of you.  I am excited that there are two more companies that are interested in the ace/ctp basket challenge for next year''s tour...I will keep you posted!\n\nThe last event that DGM will be holding is the Winter Blast.  Details are currently being worked on.  It is set for December 15, and will be at Grubaugh Park in Ozark to benefit the Christian County Family Crisis Center.

Along with the Turkey Trot (explained in the flier) we will also have a drawing to help generate more money for the CCFCC.   I will be donating a Discatcher Sport and several other items, but want to ask all of you to see if you have an item you''d like to add.  We can beef up both the Turkey Trott and the Drawing with any donations.  If you have something let me know, or just bring it by any time before the tournament (or the day of).  Last year we were able to raise $250 in a very short time of putting the event together.  This year, the event has been posted for a year, and I am confident we can blow this number away.  If you have any questions or know of any potential sponsors, please don''t hesitate to call me.\n\nLast Friday my wife Melissa, daughter Angelia, Ozark''s course pro Jeff Beth, and myself had the privilege of visiting the Christian County Family Crisis Center.  We were given the opportunity to have a Disc Golf demonstration.  This was a lot of fun and well received by all te staff, mom''s, and the children that were there.  The curiosity of the â€œchain thingsâ€ and the â€œfrisbeesâ€ drew the attention of all the kids.  All of them were eager to try out the sport new to them.  The smiles and laughter of everyone involved was priceless.  The ages of the seven children were 2 â€“ 13.  I am sure most of you share in the my following thought; The fascination of a disc/frisbee in flight, the sound of crashing chains, and the thrill of teaching the sport to someone new will always be a part of me...I truly love this game!  I believe there were some kids twho will always remember the sport, and with any luck, they will get a chance to play on a course one day soon!\n\nIt was a privilege to be a part of this experience.  At the end of our time, I watched the kids continue to play as Jeff and I put together an Innova Discatcher Sport target that Innova gave me at a generous discount for the demo.  Once it was set up I asked the kids to line up and each were given their own individual disc (provided by EDGE), mini, pen, and sticker.  They were also told the new Discatcher Sport basket was theirs to keep in their play area.  The smiles and gratitude were easily seen all over the kids faces.  The Center was also given several sets of discs (provided by Innova) in hopes that the sport will continue to bring a bit of happiness for families who truly need just that.\n\nA special thanks to Creator Designs, Gateway Disc Sports, Quality Trim & Sign, Innova Champion Discs, EDGE, Jeff Beth, Melissa Burns, Angelia Burns, and all the staff that allowed us to make this time happen! \n\nAt this time of Thanksgiving, I am truly thankful for all the many blessings that have been graciously given to me.  The list is endless: Family, Friends, Church, Home, Business...just to name a few.  I am truly thankful to all of you who have continued to support my dream/efforts in helping this sport grow.  It has been an awesome flight as we have all seen the sport of Disc Golf soar!  I know that without each of you, I couldn''t have done my part...for this I say Thank You!! \n\nSee You at the Winter Blast!', '2012-11-19 10:43:57', 1, 1, 1);

Locally, I''m sure all of us have seen the many new faces at the surrounding parks in casual rounds, leagues, and tournaments.  With these new players and the veterans of the sport, the tournament participation boomed.  Talking with other promoters in the US has been equally exciting because the growth seems to be everywhere.

This is a tournament in which we all can give back in this time of giving.  HyVee, Price Cutter, Wal Mart, and Q102 have all provided help for this event already.

There were many conversations about the high temperatures, but none of these were complaints that I heard.  Thirty-four players in five divisions participated at Grubaugh Park in Ozark, Missouri to help raise money for the Christian County Family Crisis Center.  The support by the players, sponsors, and the CCFCC was nothing short of awesome.\n\nThe most exciting part of the Winter Blast for me was to see how much we were able to help the CCFCC this year.  Along with donations, a $5 or 5 can donation (as part of the entry), a $5 mulligan option, and a Drawing (new this year) this year''s Winter Blast raised $604 more than doubling last year''s total.  There was also, food and some clothing given as well.  Jessica Guccione, Director of the CCFCC was very excited and seemed surprised as she was told what all had been raised.  Jessica showed up in time for the fun Turkey Trot game.  The Turkey Trot is a game where players trade their tickets (earned or purchased) for closest to the pin throws.  The players who through the closest were given the turkeys that were donated.  Jessica also helped with the fun drawing and awards.  In all I think she was amazed by everyone''s giving and also noticed the fun spirit that was all around.\n\nDespite the wind, there was some very good golf played.  Jeff Beth and Tyler Foreman took the time to add a 19th swinging hole to the course making par 57.  This was a lot of fun and much appreciated (Thanks Fellas for the extra work).  Winners included: Brandy Monnahan (Wn), Brad Hilton (Int), Brandon Donnelly (Rec), Lee Griffitts (Masters), and Russ Burns (Open).  The closest battle was definitely in the Masters division where Lee was able to pull off a sudden death victory over Jeff.  I want to point out that Mike Porter not only cashed at a â€œMonkeyâ€ event, he shot the best 1st round of all the players.  Also, a big shout out to Chad Fisk for bringing his mom to play and for moving up and making an incredible 2nd place showing in the Open division! One last note...Brad move up!!

Nick told me the plan was to buy as many Tablets as he could for the Special Needs Students with the money we raised. Needless to say, Nick and the whole congregation, was blown away by the number of players that came to support and the $900 raised at the event!  A true Mission Accomplished.  \r\n\r\nForty-four players showed up despite less than 2 weeks of promotion.  The 13 hole temp course offered quite a variety of shots despite a lack of trees.  The Bethel course proved to be rather challenging and difficult.  Elevation and wind were the challenges of the day.  Players were offered mulligans as a way to raise additional money and help lower scores.  There was also a raffle with many donated prizes including an Innova Discatcher Sport as the grand prize.  Both forms of fund raising were a successful.   \r\n\r\nWinners included, Matt Williams (Junior Division), Janey Helton (Womens Division), Mike Abbott (Recreational Division), Brandon Bare (Intermediate Division), Kyle Tutor (Advanced Division), and Russ Burns (Open Division).

Teachers, aids, the principal, the Autism representative, and the kids were ecstatic when the tablets were handed out. It was explained to us that these tablets are like a key that helps unlock things stored up inside the students minds.

Hope to see you Friday!\r\n\r\nThere will be 3 Divisions:\r\nPro $30/ Team ($15/ Player)\r\nAdv $20/ Team ($10/ Player)\r\nAm $20/ Team ($10/ Player)', '2013-11-06 22:06:46', 1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO `ladedgm_news` VALUES(273, 1, 'The Finale Recap', 'The Disc Golf Monkey''s Going Bananas Tour 2013 came to an end on November 9th .  The season Finale held on Bethel Assembly''s course here in Springfield, MO, was an awesome conclusion to a successful, eventful, and fun tour.  A maxed out 90 player field was treated to a very nice Player''s Pack that included lunch (provided by many volunteers), a dinner snack (provided by Little Caesars), a Going Bananas Tour disc, a full color Dye Supplimation Shami (screened by Bill McCarty), a long sleeve Dri Fit shirt (screened by Journey Post), and an exclusive Tour Finale 3D Mini.  The retail price on the packs was around $70-$80.  All of the goodies were given as a â€œthank you) to all in attendance for an incredible and memorable season.\r\n\r\nThe weather was near perfect for a November 9th date.  Sunny, a bit breezy at times, and warm made for an enjoyable two rounds.  The course which was part permanent and part temp proved to be challenging.  Adding OB''s, drop zones, and temp holes to the permanent course provided a challenge that made players use many types of shots that were often â€œrisk/rewardâ€.  Before the tournament I asked many players what they thought would win Open and the other divisions.  Almost all guessed the scores a few to several more under than what actually won.  Courses always seem to play a little tougher on tournament day.  \r\n\r\nAll the Divisions seem to be very tight battles.  I can only go by scores in the other divisions, but in the Open I can tell you it was very close with several players battling.  My 9 under for the day held off Doug Wiegand by only one stroke.  Two strokes behind the pace were John Manion who started 5 off the lead in the first round (shooting a 46 final round) and Kyle Webster''s  9 down 45 was the hot round of the day.  To all of you in the Open division thanks for the battle, it was stressful and fun! 1st and 2nd place in the other divisions were: \r\n(FPO) Tara Hadick (138)\r\n(FA1) Brandy Monahan (125) & Christine West (126) \r\n(FA3) Heather Donnely (154) & Bonnie Douglas (162)\r\n(MA1) Jacob Hink (101) & Mike Porter (103)\r\n(MA2) Aaron Cook (102) & Kieren DisClafani (105)\r\n(MA3) Nick DeRosa (108) & Tyler Webster (110)\r\n(MG1) Bruce Heidebrecht (111) & Jon Parsons (114)\r\n(MM1) George Eudy (110) & Scott â€œThe Legend in His Own Mindâ€ Elam (111)\r\nCongratulations to all of you and the other players who cashed in their divisions.\r\n\r\nAfter the rounds several drawings were done.  There were 6 in all including:\r\nVibram''s Ace/CTP contest. Winner Alonzo Conner\r\nLegacy''s Ace/CTP contest. Winner Scott Ringham\r\nMillennium''s Ace/CTP contest. Winner George Eudy\r\nDynamic Discs Ace/CTP contest. Winner Kyle McClure\r\nThe apparel basket give a way winner was present, but like a bone head I miss placed the ticket. Who ever you are contact me so I can put your name on here! Thanks.\r\nThe last drawing was to raise money for the course at Bethel.  $955 was raised putting the total over $1100 when combined with Â½ the Ace Pool money since no aces were hit.  Congratulations and thank you to all who contributed! \r\n\r\nI''d like to once again thank all of you who chose to come to the Finale and any of the other Tour events. Disc Golf Monkey supporters are the Greatest!  A special thanks to Bethel Assembly for letting us use their facilities and for the volunteer work to serve and clean up after us.  To Pastor Nick for his vision and letting me be a part and also for an awesome message of the â€œTruthâ€. Last to my awesome Family who support and allow me to do what I enjoy.  I love you Angelia and Melissa.  You are both the Best! ', '2013-11-21 11:08:52', 1, 1, 1);

At least this year no one will need to bring any coolers to keep the turkeys frozen!  This is the Turkey Trot event so you will have several opportunities to win a turkey or ham. After three tries, in consecutive years, we will finally have a true â€œWinterâ€ Blast...Brrrrrrrr!!\r\n\r\nIf you plan on coming please note that the entry is only $20 and 5 cans of food or an additional $5.  You can also donate other items listed on the bottom of the flier in lieu of the canned goods.  All donations will be going to the CCFCC.  I believe I may have a few items for a small raffle as well.  If you have any extra items on the list, an extra turkey or ham in the freezer, or any item to donate to the raffle bring them.

I received a phone call from Kyle McClure a few days before the World''s informing me that the FBCS was interested in a Disc Golf Course.  Two days later he was wanting me to print out an invoice!  What an incredible blessing.  The next few weeks were spent building baskets.  I am proud to say that the first Monkey Traps turned out nothing short of breathtaking.  Ashley Patterson, the Director of SportsLife, requested Red and did she ever pick right.  I have received many phone calls, e mails, and text messages letting me know that the baskets are beautiful and they catch amazingly well. \r\n\r\nThe installation of this course started with the holes being drilled by several volunteers from the FBCS, home of the SportsLife Disc Golf Course.  Jake Whitehead (Member TEAM MONKEY), Ashley Patterson, and Myself (Russ Burns), set the posts in concrete finishing just after night fall.  Several of the the Tee Signs were also placed in the ground that evening by Kyle McClure (Member TEAM MONKEY & FBCS).  The rest of the project was completed on Saturday September 12th , by several   more eager church attendees including Minister of Children Greg Westmoreland and iSite Minister Chris Swain.  The much anticipated course was played that same day by several of the volunteers and other excited players.  I would like to thank all who made this project happen; Jesus Christ (who in everything I know I am blessed), My girls (wife Melissa & daughter Angelia), SBC staff, Kyle McClure, Rick (Performance Coating Joplin, MO), Mike (Amazing Chaney''s Auto body & Paint), Zach (Lowe''s of Joplin, MO), and Jake Whitehead.  To all of you I am indebted and I thank each of you for allowing my dreams to become reality!', '2009-09-22 10:26:44', 0, '2009-09-22 11:00:50');

The live music opened up Friday night with Meridian Shift of which 3 of the 5 band members are disc golfers themselves (Brandon Duncan, Adam West, and Kyle Sunde). \n	The course was 19 holes and although it was on the shorter side in length, it was very challenging. Russ Burns was given a very rough piece of land to work with and somehow managed to create one of the most interesting courses I have ever played. The reports from those who played the course were definitely positive. Thank you Russ for all your hard work and dedication. If your drive didnâ€™t stay on the fairway there were probably thorns in your future. There was considerable blood shed on this course as well as many lost discs. \n	In Saturdays tournament Russ Burns won the open division.  Mark Anderson and Aaron Ulrich had a playoff for first in the advanced division were Mark brought home the victory. Jaysin Smith took top honors among the intermediate players and Kyle Sunde blew away the competition in beginners. \n	On Sunday 2 rounds of double were played. The first round was random draw doubles, Russ Burns and Rick Nichols won that round shooting a -17 with an ace. The Second round was pick your partner and Aaron Ulrich and Rick Nichols shot -16 that round. During the second round of doubles 2 set of chains (The Missing Links) were hidden on the course.

I have 3 more courses that I am working on that will hopefully be completed by Spring.  If all goes well, they will be in three different states!

The U of A Disc Golf Club, asked the Monkey to help run the event because of some merchandise issues (having to do with logo permission).  The opportunity to help the U of A Disc Golf Club Team was gladly excepted and was an overwhelming success!  Ryan Black, the club president, said, â€œ...I would have to say that this Razorback Classic was likely our best tournament and turnout.â€!  For this I am thankful to all of the 69 players who came to play.  Thank you to each of you who supported the club in the Raffle as well!  The U of A thanks you as they prepare and head to the Collegiate Disc Golf Championship!\r\n\r\nThe record field of 69 players was a surprise to most.  Speaking briefly with Ryan on Monday the estimation was around 50.  There were several Pro players including 9 Open and 5 Pro Masters.  The rest were in the Amateur divisions splitting up into Advanced, Intermediate, and Rec.  The day was near perfect with temperature in the mid to upper 70''s with a gentle breeze.  The divisions leaders battled in a very tight race in most divisions with several ties!  Winners of the 2011 Arkansas Razorback Open were: Teresa Duff (Adv Women), Kevin Jones (Adv), Roberto Hernandez & Joseph Brandenburger (Int Tie), Arnulfo Manjarrz, Daniel Kuhen, and Jamie Hernandez (Rec), Joe Huss (Grand Masters), Jose Mendoza (Pro Masters), and the Monkey himself, Russ Burns (Open).  Congratulations to all of you!\r\n\r\nWith over $900 in merchandise being fronted/donated to the event by DGM, and a few hundred more being donated by players, the U of A collected the amount that they needed for their funds to be matched by the school.  The Razorback Raffle, partial entry fees, and half the Ace Pot brought in the donation.  Thank you for supporting the Razorback Classic.

Along with the McClelland Park''s face lift sporting 27 Monkey Traps, there will also be 9 temporary Monkey Traps completing the 36 holes that will be played this weekend (Thank you guys for bringing your Traps!).  This event will be the largest in our area, and credit needs to be given to the JDGC and the players who have stuck with it making both the club and The 4 States such a success!  A special thanks to Todd Calhoon, Kevin Carder, Michael Cory, and Andrew Jinks for leading the JDGC in the direction that most can only hope for.  I would also like to thank Pat Wooley for his efforts in bringing much needed new baskets to McClelland Park!  I am honored to be a member of the club and proud to be a part of such a successful event.  \r\n\r\nIf you have played this event before, you know and would probably agree this course can test your skills with the terrain being it''s biggest challenge.  Rolling hills spread throughout the course with mature trees everywhere.  There is a great mix of short and long holes and just enough OB to make things interesting.  If this is your 1st time playing this course/tournament I am sure you will find McClelland and the 4 States Open a venue you will probably return to!

With the DGM Finale last month as the conclusion of the 2011 Evolution Tour, we are excited to offer one last tournament.  Before, during, and after the Finale I was asked if it would be my last event of the year, and with some gentle persuasion I decided to make one last go in 2011.  It was easy  deciding where to hold this event especially with the â€œnewnessâ€ at the beautiful and redesigned Grubaugh Park in Ozark, MO.  With Jeff Beth at the helm, the Grubaugh course has under gone a very successful face lift, making it arguably the best course in the Springfield area.  \r\n\r\nJeff Beth and I discussed a tournament and agreed the Winter Blast Tournament would be a fun idea and would allow the new design to be showcased.  Along with the opportunity to play the new lay out, we also agreed it would make a perfect opportunity to help a local charity (much like the Ice Bowl''s).  In only a short one day notice, Jeff found a much deserving charity to play for.  The Christian County Family Crisis Center is local to Ozark and provides many services to the area.  Lynn Buehler, one of the directors, spoke with us and thought it sounded like a great idea.  Having never heard of the sport, she mentioned possibly playing in the future (when it warms up of coarse).  Jeff and I are excited about this event and hope you can make it!   \r\n\r\nI hope that this will be a last â€œFixâ€ that will get people through to the Ice Bowl season.  This event is designed to be fun filled, charity driven, and showcase a more challenging 18 at Grubaugh.  This event will have a very fun an unique twist called the Mulligan Turkey Trott (MTT).  As the flier mentions there will be 6 mulligans sold for $5.  With this $5 donation (that will be given to the CCFCC) you will be entered into the MTT.  For every turkey you get (Turkey = 3 consecutive birdies), you will earn a shot at a short CTP hole at the end of play.  For those who wish to save their Mulligans, the Mulligans may be traded for shots at the CTP.  So far we have been given 2 Turkeys to give out by Price Cutter (thanks for the leg work Jeff)!  The MTT should be a great time and will allow more money to be raised for the CCFCC.  As always, expect the same â€œMonkey Style Pay Outâ€ which is picking your own winnings from the Monkey Mobile Store.\r\n\r\nHow can you help?  First, we need to spread the word about this event and get as many players to play as possible.  The more players we have, the more we raise for the CCFCC.  Second, We are needing donations in one of two ways.  Along with the 5 cans of food or $5 as part of the entry, Lynn has provided a top needs list for the CCFCC that include:  Non perishable food (cereals especially), cleaning supplies, laundry and other soap items, and women/children''s clothing (please bring gently used or new clothing items).  If you have any way of getting these types of items, please bring them to the event and they will be donated.  Also, we are wanting to have more than just Turkeys to give out at the Turkey Trott.  Any prize type items would be greatly appreciated (these do not have to be disc golf related).  The last way you can help is by letting us know if you know a business/individual that would like to be a part through a sponsorship.  If you do please let Jeff or I know know as soon as possible!  â€œTis the seasonâ€, and our season to help others continues!\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, about this event, or the upcoming 2012 Tour (including your city being a part) please do not hesitate to contact me.  See ya soon and Aces to you!', '2011-12-08 04:52:12', 0, '2011-12-08 16:58:44');
INSERT INTO `ladedgm_newsrev` VALUES(232, 171, 1, '4th Annual Lebanon Ice Bowl Recap', 'The 4th Annual Lebanon Ice Bowl was a record shattering event for Lebanon''s disc golf community!  The sixty-six players this year nearly doubled the amount from last year''s 36.  The 30 extra players helped raise $1,060, topping last year''s total of $576.  The Lebanon Area Foundation will be presented with the check very soon along with the food that was donated.  I am so excited by the over whelming support that was given to both the LAF and to DGM.  I am very thankful that you chose Lebanon to finish out the Ice Bowl season. You guys are incredible.  Great work and Thank You to all of you.\r\n\r\nIf the attendance and money raised for the LAF was not enough, the weather, play, and the pay out may  have rounded off a near perfect day of disc golf.  Rarely can this Arizona native wear a long sleeve shirt and survive in February, but the crazy warmth of this winter continued.  Sunshine with a moderate wind, was a prime recipe for a beautiful day of disc golf. There were 5 divisions that included: Open, Advanced, Intermediate, Recreational, and Women.  All divisions were very competitive with the biggest margin of victory being only 3 strokes in the Women''s division.  Melissa White from Jeff City bested Brandy Monnahan with a 137. The Rec division won by Mark Komoroski shooting a 112, was the tightest field in the tournament.  Second place was a 3 way tie for second only a stroke off the pace by Tuner, Jonathan Cook, and Mike Sisco.  Winning the Intermediate field was Springfield''s own Nathan Clark turning in a 105 that held off Nate Love by a stick.  Kyle Webster''s 101 was enough for a two stroke finish over fellow Joplin golfer Frank â€œthe Tankâ€.  The Open division was full of excitement from start to finish.  Corey''s ace helped give him a considerable 3 stroke lead over Zack Jones, Shayn Woltz and myself.  With a 43 matched by Mark Anderson, I was able to win by a single stroke making my 49 first round score, only one better than Mark''s in the first round making the difference.  For full results, click on the Tournament Tab, scroll down to Past Tournaments,  and click on results.\r\n\r\nThe pay out was nothing short of amazing for the Ice Bowl.  The ultimate winner was Nathan Clark winning both his division, and the custom $375 Monkey Trap that was raffled off to helped raise money for the LAF.  I often tell players if they are looking for an over the top Pay Out the Ice Bowl is not one to play.  This was far from the truth for this payout because of money added to the pay out by individuals in attendance.  Like all DGM events, vouchers used like cash on merchandise were given out, along with a Pro cash pay out.  Many players commented on how mind boggling the pay out was.  On behalf of all the players, I say thank you to all the sponsors and the City of Lebanon for their support of this year''s Lebanon Ice Bowl.  I am looking forward to June, as the Lucky Monkey Tour will return to Lebanon''s Atchley Park for the Jared Hilton Memorial Tournament.', '2012-02-29 10:52:44', 0, '2012-02-29 22:58:07');

Sixty nine players from four different states took part in the event.\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd, the Monkey Tour will take us to Miami, OK for it''s first PDGA event. The 1st Riverview Open will be held at Riverview park. The Ottawa County Disc Golf Club (OCDGC) has been diligently raising money for the event. The following weekend on May 30th, we will be headed south to Bentonville, AR for the 2nd Annual Lake Bella VistOpen. Randal Reisner (part of Team Monkey) has started the ball rolling and has come up with quite a few sponsors. We will be adding $500 cash to the Pro payout and the same amount will be divided in the Amateur fields! Both events will be well worth the trip.

Ray, who owns Noel Pharmacy in Noel, MO, has worked hard to round up support for this event.  He has rallied sponsors from around Noel and along the Elk River that we will be floating down for the tourney.  The list is impressive being that there is no course in the local area.  Sponsors include: Noel Pharmacy, PBA Health, Landon Feed & Seed, Kathy''s Kountry Kitchen, The Hog Shop, Arvest Bank, McDonald County, Main Sweets, Annie''s Pizza, and Bluff Dwellers Cavern.  Along with all the DGM 2012 Lucky Monkey Tour Sponsors this event is definitely highly anticipated and supported.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on the flier, we will be doing registration at the Harp''s Grocery Store in Noel, MO.  \r\n\r\nYOU MUST REGISTER (OR CHECK IN IF PRE REGISTERED) BETWEEN 7:00 and 11:00 AM!!.\r\n\r\nYou may also pre register for this event at my shop, at the Player''s Cup, or through Pay Pal (directions below), but you will still need to check in before 11:00.

The reason for the dead line is because the float is several hours long and when combining the 18 holes, well, it will take a while.\r\n\r\nFor those who are going to camp, there are several sites that are supporting this event.  Shady Beach at http://www.shadybeach.com , River Ranch http://www.riverranchresort.com , and Two Sons http://www.twosonsfloats.com .

I''m sure cabins are limited so reserve early.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Floatin'' Fling has caught the attention of many around the area.  I am very excited that one of my best and longest supporting sponsors will be at this one.  My great friends and owners of Discs Unlimited, Dennis & Annetta Volshultz, have said they will be there.  Dennis mentioned today (as several of you have) he was happy that disc golf and floating were combined because they were two of his favorite things to do.

Also cashing, was TJ Hahn and Chad Fisk who finished second with a very respectable 55.  These were incredible scores for a calm day, but for the winds that day provided the scores were obscene.  Great job fellas!  \r\n\r\nSaturday''s forecast was beautiful and made for a very enjoyable event.  There were 57 players with 7 divisions.  The course played tough as expected, with only two players finishing under par.  Both Frank the Tank, and Zack Jones were rewarded for their stellar performances winning their divisions.  Open champion â€œTankâ€, put together a brilliant second round 6 under that distanced himself above second place finisher George Smith.  Zack, who has been playing Open, elected to play Advanced and smashed the field...Is sand bagger to harsh I ask?  Great shooting bud!  Other winners included: C D Steiner a true legend of the game out of Kansas City took the Pro Masters division over local Jon Parsons (who moved up for this event), Stan Balke took 1st in the Advanced Grand Masters division, Brenda Lowe in the Women''s division, Kenneth Squires who played a long play off with Brad Hilton before taking the crown in Intermediate, and Tyler Foreman who has had back to back wins on the tour earning him the SAND BAGGER award (No more Recreation for you Tyler)!

May was a crazy month with basket making, tournaments, and a miserable bout with Pneumonia.  I have learned way more about Pneumonia than I ever wanted to know.  With out boring you with details, I want to say it had me down for the count for over two weeks.  Thanks to all of you who sent hope, thoughts, and prayer.  They were all welcomed and extremely appreciated!  Thank You!!\r\n\r\nThere were two tournaments in May that were unique and firsts for the area.  Hats off to Shayn Woltz and Jeff Beth for putting on an awesome Match Play Event.  The Ozarks Flying Disc Club''s Inaugural Player''s Cup Weekend was an awesome test of both mental and physical ability.  In talking with some of the other players in the tournament, most seemed to say that staying focused along with executing time after time was key.  For those who missed the event, the tournament was match play and the bracket was set up by a random draw.  The first two matches were played on the 1st original 9 in Ozark followed by the second round being played on the original back 9.  All the rest of the matches were done on a stretched out 18 Safari type course.  Crazy awesome time!  Can''t wait to do this again.  A huge congratulations to Zack Jones of Joplin, MO for taking home the 1st place title!  Very well played Zack.  Again I want to thank Shayn and Jeff for putting this on!\r\n\r\nAnother first was the Floatin'' Monkey Fling.  This was the first event of it''s kind that I know of.  Raymond Kirk, the brain child of the event, mentioned doing this to me last year at the Finale.  It was awesome to see how excited and willing he was to make it happen.  Ray single handedly set up the course, organized sponsorships, and pulled the local area together to make tournament happen.  My apologies Ray for my body deciding to shut off before the event, but a huge congratulations for making it all happen!  Thirty-five players played and endured a long day of floatin'' and flingin'' along the Elk River!  Winners included Kyle Webster (Open), John Sheafer (Adv), Buddy Larue and Steve Hare(Int), Jesse Kirk (Rec), and Greg Fehrenbach (Nov).  Congratulations to you all!\r\n\r\nI will be making a post tomorrow about the Jared Hilton Memorial which is next on the Monkey Tour 2012.

After four years of playing and enjoying the sport of disc golf Iâ€™m proud to announce that Pittsburg KS will be getting 18 Monkey Traps installed in Schlanger Park for this years 3rd Annual PITT Open.  Concrete tee pads, signs and other additions will follow late summer into early fall as a result of two grants that were received for this new course.  I would like to thank the City of Pittsburg Parks and Rec, Russ Burns and anyone else that has helped in making this dream a reality.  Like some great events already in Kansas (i.e Glass Blown Open) we have started off small and continue to grow each and every year.

Donate them, and you will receive one raffle ticket for every pair you bring. At the end of the tournament, I will draw a winning ticket and the person holding it will receive a free pair of Keen Shoes.  It''s that simple!  I couldn''t think of a better prize then a new pair of shoes for an old pair, or two, or three... The donated shoes will be collected the day of the event by Sole Food, and later be sold.  The money then goes towards  feeding the hungry.

The most exciting of the records was the charity amounts raised and  contributed.  Nearly $4,500 was raised.

It is Time to Recap 2012 and and show what DGM has scheduled for 2013!\r\n\r\nThe Lucky Monkey Tour 2012 was the best DGM Tour to date.  It was a record breaking season in nearly every aspect.  The Tour''s 11 PDGA events had 6 tournaments fill to maximum capacity or more.  With tournaments filling and going over the maximum capacity it was not a huge surprise to see the average number of players at 88.  The most exciting of the records was the charity amounts raised and  contributed.  Nearly $4,500 was raised.  All of these awesome records were because all of you continue to support local disc golf and DGM.  To say â€œthank youâ€ is not enough, and my goal is to show my gratitude by continuing to move the sport forward in every way possible!   \r\n\r\nAbove you read about the charitable contributions raised by the Lucky Monkey Tour and wanted to provide the details.

Our goal is to gather food for the Victory Mission''s food bank and to raise money for the Truman Elementary Special Needs Program.  I asked Pastor Nick to provide some in site in to what exactly the funds will be going toward. \r\n\r\nWe are looking to raise money for a very worthy cause. With autism and the wide spectrum of special needs that these words now cover is growing epidemic and with more funds being taken away from this group of people they need our help.  We are looking to raise $1,900 to purchase computer tablets for special needs children in the Truman Elementary school. With this money we hope to purchase 3 tablets per classroom which would be 3 classrooms.  Tablets are great tools for children with special needs because they open a door to the mind and enable them to communicate through this tool in a way they couldn''t before. These children are trapped in their minds and unable to communicate what they need or what they are feeling. Can you imagine being locked in your mind without being able to express yourself. Some of these kids are super intelligent but are unable to share what they have because it is all locked up. We want to give them a key to open a new world of possibilities for them and their families.  I want to take a moment to thank Russ for his help in putting this event together and look forward to the possibility of creating a permanent course on the church property at Bethel Assembly. All you die hard disc golfers know we need another course or two or three or....... help make all this happen.

My apologies for not posting earlier, but I have been working on both this event and the new DGM mobile trailer that I am sure everyone will enjoy.  Nearly 60 players have pre registered and I have heard that there are several others coming, but plan on paying the day of.  I am hoping to reach 90 again this year, and will allow up to 100 players.  Remember only the first 90 players are guaranteed a players pack so get registered.  All players will receive a disc and have food provided by this years food sponsor Little Caesars (Thanks Zach Pirwitz for making this happen)!\r\n\r\nWhat is new this year in the Going Bananas Tour? \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above I have a new mobile store that measures 25'' which is 8'' longer, 4â€ taller, and 4â€ wider.  This means a lot more merchandise can be stored.  With over 450 discs coming in the last few weeks, and new Tour Apparel just in, I am ready to  offer an even better selection during pay out time. I can''t wait until Saturday to make the debut!\r\n\r\nAlso new this year are several large sponsorships that will benefit everyone.  I would like to welcome back all my previous sponsors and welcome aboard Legacy Discs, Dynamic Discs, and the Journey Post. Vibram has chosen to do another CTP/ACE Competition  this year and will again result in a Monkey Trap to be given away.  I am super excited to officially announce that Millennium Discs, Legacy Discs, and Dynamic Discs are joining in this awesome exclusive DGM CTP/ACE Competition.  That''s right, each player will now have 4 chances to win awesome CTP packages and 4 chances to qualify in taking home 4 Monkey Traps at the end of the year.  Remember there is no cost involved.  Simply use the brand disc that the hole is being sponsored by and you are eligible!\r\n\r\nThe Going Bananas tour also has some PDGA Tier changes to some of the events.  The big tier change is that of the 4 States Open which is registered as the first ever A Tier on tour.  The Joplin Disc Golf Club, has worked very hard and has proven that they are capable of not only running a large event, but running one well!  Congratulations to all involved in making this happen.  The Pitt Open is also moving up to a B Tier and will offer 2 days and two courses.  The Monkey Trap Open in Springdale, AR will also be a B Tier thanks to NNWA for there continued support of this event. There are two new stops on the Tour as well.  Both Rolla, MO and Harrison, AR are welcomed additions to this years Tour.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more updates, and I hope to see many of you in Republic this Saturday!

I am confident in saying this course will challenge you! Thanks to Pastor Nick, Josiah Durham, Jake Whitehead, and Eddie Uhlan for their work on the course!\r\n\r\nCome prepared for a great time! To all of you who have supported the tour and can''t make this one Thank You for your continued support, and I hope to see you next year!', '2013-11-05 09:29:35', 0, '2013-11-05 09:58:56');
INSERT INTO `ladedgm_newsrev` VALUES(455, 273, 1, 'The Finale Recap', 'The Disc Golf Monkey''s Going Bananas Tour 2013 came to an end on November 9th .  The season Finale held on Bethel Assembly''s course here in Springfield, MO, was an awesome conclusion to a successful, eventful, and fun tour.  A maxed out 90 player field was treated to a very nice Player''s Pack that included lunch (provided by many volunteers), a dinner snack (provided by Little Caesars), a Going Bananas Tour disc, a full color Dye Supplimation Shami (screened by Bill McCarty), a long sleeve Dri Fit shirt (screened by Journey Post), and an exclusive Tour Finale 3D Mini.  The retail price on the packs was around $70-$80.  All of the goodies were given as a â€œthank you) to all in attendance for an incredible and memorable season.\r\n\r\nThe weather was near perfect for a November 9th date.  Sunny, a bit breezy at times, and warm made for an enjoyable two rounds.  The course which was part permanent and part temp proved to be challenging.  Adding OB''s, drop zones, and temp holes to the permanent course provided a challenge that made players use many types of shots that were often â€œrisk/rewardâ€.  Before the tournament I asked many players what they thought would win Open and the other divisions.  Almost all guessed the scores a few to several more under than what actually won.  Courses always seem to play a little tougher on tournament day.  \r\n\r\nAll the Divisions seem to be very tight battles.  I can only go by scores in the other divisions, but in the Open I can tell you it was very close with several players battling.  My 9 under for the day held off Doug Wiegand by only one stroke.  Two strokes behind the pace were John Manion who started 5 off the lead in the first round (shooting a 46 final round) and Kyle Webster''s  9 down 45 was the hot round of the day.  To all of you in the Open division thanks for the battle, it was stressful and fun! 1st and 2nd place in the other divisions were: \r\n(FPO) Tara Hadick (138)\r\n(FA1) Brandy Monahan (125) & Christine West (126) \r\n(FA3) Heather Donnely (154) & Bonnie Douglas (162)\r\n(MA1) Jacob Hink (101) & Mike Porter (103)\r\n(MA2) Aaron Cook (102) & Kieren DisClafani (105)\r\n(MA3) Nick DeRosa (108) & Tyler Webster (110)\r\n(MG1) Bruce Heidebrecht (111) & Jon Parsons (114)\r\n(MM1) George Eudy (110) & Scott â€œThe Legend in His Own Mindâ€ Elam (111)\r\nCongratulations to all of you and the other players who cashed in their divisions.\r\n\r\nAfter the rounds several drawings were done.  There were 6 in all including:\r\nVibram''s Ace/CTP contest. Winner Alonzo Conner\r\nLegacy''s Ace/CTP contest. Winner Scott Ringham\r\nMillennium''s Ace/CTP contest. Winner George Eudy\r\nDynamic Discs Ace/CTP contest. Winner Kyle McClure\r\nThe apparel basket give a way winner was present, but like a bone head I miss placed the ticket. Who ever you are contact me so I can put your name on here! Thanks.\r\nThe last drawing was to raise money for the course at Bethel.  $955 was raised putting the total over $1100 when combined with Â½ the Ace Pool money since no aces were hit.  Congratulations and thank you to all who contributed! \r\n\r\nI''d like to once again thank all of you who chose to come to the Finale and any of the other Tour events. Disc Golf Monkey supporters are the Greatest!  A special thanks to Bethel Assembly for letting us use their facilities and for the volunteer work to serve and clean up after us.  To Pastor Nick for his vision and letting me be a part and also for an awesome message of the â€œTruthâ€. Last to my awesome Family who support and allow me to do what I enjoy.  I love you Angelia and Melissa.  You are both the Best! ', '2013-11-21 11:08:52', 0, '2013-11-21 11:16:18');

My wife and I laughed and said, hey they are advertising the tourney, but in reality, as you know, they were informing everyone of the brutal weather that we are still receiving this week.  At least this year no one will need to bring any coolers to keep the turkeys frozen!  This is the Turkey Trot event so you will have several opportunities to win a turkey or ham. After three tries, in consecutive years, we will finally have a true â€œWinterâ€ Blast...Brrrrrrrr!!\r\n\r\nIf you plan on coming please note that the entry is only $20 and 5 cans of food or an additional $5.  You can also donate other items listed on the bottom of the flier in lieu of the canned goods.  All donations will be going to the CCFCC.  I believe I may have a few items for a small raffle as well.  If you have any extra items on the list, an extra turkey or ham in the freezer, or any item to donate to the raffle bring them.  On behalf of the CCFCC Thank You for all the support.  I''m looking forward to this event, and I hope to see as many of you there as possible!

Learn to throw the disc you have, get\n		comfortable with them, donâ€™t constantly change them up. Get\n		ahold of USDGC or Worlds DVDâ€™s and watch the proâ€™s play.\n		Drive for show, Put for dough, Doesnâ€™t matter how good the\n		drive is if you canâ€™t make the put, Practice, Practice,\n		Practice.</p>\n		<p>Additional\n		comments:</p>\n		<p>First\n		and foremost, Iâ€™ve got to give credit where credit is due. I\n		thank God for the gifts Heâ€™s given me. An awesome wife who also\n		enjoys the game, and supports me all the way. And of course my\n		sponser, Russ Burns for taking the time to show me the game, allowing\n		me to be a part of his team and for being a good friend.</p>\n		<p><strong>Player\n		bio</strong></p>\n		<p>Division:\n		AM</p>\n		<p>PDGA#:\n		37859</p>\n		<p>Home:\n		Springfield MO.</p>\n		<p>Years\n		playing: Less than a year</p>\n		<p>Born:\n		10/28/82</p>\n		<p>2008\n		Events: 6</p>\n		<p>Rating:\n		872</p>\n	</div>\n\n	<ul>\n		<li><p><a href="#Jake">Jacob Whitehead</a></p></li>\n		<li><p><a href="#Kyle">Kyle McClure</a></p></li>\n		<li><p><a href="#Randal">Randal Reisner</a></p></li>\n		<li><p><a href="http://www.pdga.com//player_stats/43928">Kevin Carder</a></p></li>\n	</ul>\n\n\n	<h2 id="Kyle">Kyle</h2>\n	<div class="cms">\n		<p><strong>Playing Gear</strong></p>\n		<p><strong>Distance Drivers:</strong><strong><br>\n		</strong><strong>1 </strong><i><strong>Star Destroyer</strong></i>: I use this disc when I am throwing distance in a tail wind(400 plus ft).

In 2004 I won a C-tier (Dovillo ousted), B-tier (Stillwater Classic) and an A-tier (Oklahoma Open) back to back. That was one of the best touring seasons I had as an AM. There is no great feeling then winning a big tournament and I hope Ii can do that again as a PRO.<br>\n		<br>\n		<strong>Advice:</strong><br>\n		My advice to any player who is just starting would have to be never give up. If you get the chance to play with someone who is better do it. I learned almost everything I know today by watching other players. This game is about 90% mental and 10% physical. The only way you can get better is to keep practicing as much as you can. <br>\n		<br>\n		<strong>Additional Comments:</strong></p>\n		<p>I would like to thank my Lord and savior for giving me the ability to play this game, my wife Shannon for all the support she has given me, my doubles partner Dasun for always pushing me to play harder, and My sponsor Russ for giving me a chance to be apart of Team Monkey</p>\n		<p><br><br>\n		</p>\n		<p>Player Bio</p>\n		<p><strong>Division: </strong>Pro Open<br>\n		<strong>PDGA#:</strong> 21238<br>\n		<strong>Home:</strong> Springdale,AR <br>\n		<strong>Years Playing:</strong> 7 <br>\n		<strong>Year Born:</strong> 1982<br>\n		<strong>2008 Events:</strong> 13 <br>\n		<strong>2007 Earnings:</strong> $1427<br>\n		<strong>Rating:</strong> 978<br>\n		<strong>Fact: </strong><strong>Monkeys canâ€™t swim</strong> <br>\n		<strong>Dominant Hand:</strong> Right</p>\n		<p><br>\n		</p>\n		<p><strong>TOP FINISHES</strong></p>\n		<p><br>\n		</p>\n		<p><br>\n			<strong>2008</strong><br>\n		1st Green Country Doubles<br>\n		16th Southern National Disc Golf Championships<br>\n		<br>\n		<strong>2007</strong><br>\n		2nd Pay it forward Northshore Invitational<br>\n		<br>\n		<strong>2006</strong></p>\n		<p>1st Ben Geren Blowout</p>\n		<p>1st Northshore Invitational</p>\n		<p><br>\n			<strong>2005</strong><br>\n		3rd Hell on the Border</p>\n		<p>6th Pdga Amateur Disc Golf World Championships</p>\n\n	</div>\n\n	<ul>\n		<li><p><a href="#Jake">Jacob Whitehead</a></p></li>\n		<li><p><a href="#Kyle">Kyle McClure</a></p></li>\n		<li><p><a href="#Randal">Randal Reisner</a></p></li>\n		<li><p><a href="http://www.pdga.com//player_stats/43928">Kevin Carder</a></p></li>\n	</ul>\n\n	<h2 id="Randal">Randal</h2>\n	<div class="cms">\n        <p>In my bag:</p>\n        <p>Distance Drivers: 170g star Destroyer 175g champion  Destroyer for the 400ft plus drives, 175g star Excalibr 172g\n champion Excalibr for head wind drives   1- 175g Wraith</p>\n        <p> Fairway Drivers: 2-165g & 2-172g champion Firebirds for\n long hard hyzer & short hard hyzers  champion 1 175g & 2-170g Teebird champion for the finesse shots 1-175g\n leopard for anhyzer</p>\n        <p>Mid-Range: 2 champion for mid hyzers Rocs 2 Dx Rocs mid  anhyzer</p>\n        <p> Rollers: 2 champion Sidewinders  Putt & Approach: 2 KC 12X Aviar</p>\n        <p> FAVORITE COURSE</p>\n        <p> Winthrop - Rockhill, SC.
